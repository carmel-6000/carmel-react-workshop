## React WorkShop for Carmel6000 Students

* Remove all unnecessary code
* Change input box background color to light yellow (Use cross-files search)

* load src2: 

  # Resolve this bug: "Syntax error: Unexpected token, expected ; (10:43)
  # Notice that when clicking on "Fetch a promise with mobx" the "Hold on..." stays there after the action is done. Address this issue.

* load src3:
  
  * Resolve this bug: TypeError: this.props.TodoListStore is undefined
  * Resolve this bug: _this.todoList[index] is undefined
  * Notice that once clicking on Save - the EditEntry doesn't turn into Entry, why?
  * Notice that the Entries layout is "broken" (not divided into 60%/40%) please resolve this issue

* load src4:
   * Address all bugs you can find so that the app will work properly

* Add message "Hold on" in between the X button process (See if there is another place in which the same thing is already done)
* Implement the whole code to be inside a new app - 

The new app should be comprised of two major components:
(1) TopNavigationBar - will include 
    (a) Clear button - will clear all list within the storage
    (b) ControlPanel 
(2) AllListsPanel - will include
    (a) ListPanel
    (b) A list of all deleted items (follow the next issue for explanation)

* Clone todolist.store.js into a new store "anotherstore.store.js" and save all deleted items into that store and show it another box


* Good Luck !!
