   # Address all bugs you can find so that the app will work properly

# Add message "Hold on" in between the X button process (See if there is another place in which the same thing is already done)
# Implement the whole code to be inside a new app - with two boxes, one will include two boxes, one will include the ControlPanel component, and the other will include the ListDisplay
# Clone todolist.store.js into a new store "anotherstore.store.js" and save all deleted items into that store and show it another box


## Good Luck !!
